# Animation Package Overview

Animation components are designed to animate their content by using different animation effects. Currently, the Animation package includes the Kendo UI Fade, Expand, Push, Slide, and Zoom components for React.

The Fade animates newly-added children with a fade-in effect.

The Expand animates the CSS `height` property of the container element.

The Push slides the new component pushing the old one out.

The Slide slides a single piece of content vertically.

The Zoom displays the content with a zoom transition effect.
